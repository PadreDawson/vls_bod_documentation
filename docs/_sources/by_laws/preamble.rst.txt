In Scripture our Lord commands His people to “make disciples of all nations...teaching them everything I have commanded you” (`Matthew 28:19-20 <https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A19-20&version=ESV>`_). In response to this command, the Lutheran Church has established a long history of Christian education. In order to offer a quality education and to effectively teach the Christian faith to youth and children of all ages.
